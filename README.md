# Gaia
Project using data from Gaia's first data release

Project is contained in the file called plottinggaia.py

The code contained takes the data from the first Gaia release and selects the highest SN objects as chosen by the user. This data set can then be plotted in a couple of different ways. The current choices are:

1. Relative Velocity distribution
2. H-R diagram
3. 3D position-velocity map (Using Mayavi)
